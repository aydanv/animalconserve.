    <h1    class="one"> Animal Extinction Caused By Human Activity And Ways We Can Help </h1>
    <h1 class="question"> What is animal extinction? </h1>
    <h1> Animal extinction is the name given to an event when an animal species ceases to exist anywhere in the world. It has been a common phenomenon in the past couple of years and the numbers only seem to increase at alarming rates.  </h1>
    <h1 class="question"> What causes animal extinction? </h1>
    <h1> Animal extinction can be caused by natural phenomenons (climate change, natural selection etc.);however, the majority of these animals fall victim to this dreadful occurence due to human carelessness. According to researchers, humans have driven at least <ins>680</ins> vertebrate species to extinction since the 16th century. </h1>
    <h1 class="question"> Why should we care about animal extinction? </h1>
    <h1> Animals make up a large portion of the ecosystem, hence when a species becomes endangered/extinct, it is a sign that the ecosystem is falling apart. The loss of one animal species triggers the loss of other animal species and as humans, we depend on these species since they are important to the health of the ecosystem. </h1>
    <h1 class="question"> What are examples of animals that had been driven to extinction due to human activity?</h1>
