    This website is about spreading awareness about human caused animal extinction, which has become so prevalent, by demonstrating facts and statistics. Humans can be careless about how their day-to-day tasks indirectly affect the animal kingdom and it isn't always their fault for not knowing it. The purpose of this website is to educate people and make a positive change.  </h1>
